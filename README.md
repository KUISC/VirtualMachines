# This repo contains VMs created for practice

## 1. Download and Install VMWare
Virtual Machines can be used on either VMWare Fusion (Mac) or Workstation (Windows). They can be downloaded for free by logging into your EECS account at http://www.eecs.ku.edu/current_students. Then clicking on the `Downloads` link on the left has side. From there you click `VMWare` which takes you to an online store where you can download the software.

## 2. Clone the repo and download tarball into it
Clone repo to your local machine using
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KUInfoSecClub/VirtualMachines.git
```

We will host a temporary web server so you can download the tarball containing the machine. Save that file under the directory it is associated with. Then extract it with the following command.

```bash
$ tar -zxvf TARBALLNAME.tar.gz
```
